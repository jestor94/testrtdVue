# Studio Ghibli

## Description project
```
The objective was build a web application to show a film list and have the option to search between the list and autocomplete the text to search.

Follow the Vue values, I decided use Flux architecture but, the application is very small to show the behavior.

About the trade-offs, show that the flux architecture is 100% leveraged... Maybe with more time would show the information in the API's inside the Json for each film, example: starring (people API). 

The best part for me...I consider that all the [Filmscomponent](#films)<a id="my-anchor"></a>
